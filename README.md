# Deep Learning Based fMRI Denoising: A Comparative Analysis of 3D U-Net Attention and Wasserstein GAN Architectures for fMRI Denoising

This repository contains the official implementation for the Master's project "Deep Learning Based fMRI Denoising", comparing 3D U-Net Attention and 3DWGAN architectures. This study systematically develops and refines these models to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.

## üìù Project Overview
Functional MRI (fMRI) data is inherently corrupted by significant noise, which compromises signal quality and limits neurobiological interpretations. This project tackles this challenge by implementing and comparing two state-of-the-art deep learning paradigms. The goal is to develop a robust model that can significantly reduce noise while preserving the fine-grained anatomical and structural details essential for accurate neuroscience research.

## üìä Iterative Model Comparison

Our development process followed a methodical, iterative approach, primarily focused on the 3D U-Net architecture. Each attempt provided critical insights that informed the design of the next, culminating in a final optimized model. The table below summarizes this journey, highlighting the key decisions and their impact on performance.

| Feature / Metric | Model 1 (Baseline) | Model 2 (Data-Scaled) | Model 2 (Fine-Tuned Failure) | Model 3 (Final Optimized Model) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dataset Size** | 10 Files (~2.8k vol) | 20 Files (~5.6k vol) | Small Subsets (4-8 files) | **20 Files (~5.6k vol)** |
| **Architecture** | 3D Attn U-Net + **LSTM** | 3D Attn U-Net + **LSTM** | 3D Attn U-Net + **LSTM** | 3D Attn U-Net + **No LSTM** |
| **Loss Function** | `binary_crossentropy` | `binary_crossentropy` | `composite_loss` (Œ±=0.8) | **`composite_loss` (Œ±=0.5)** |
| **Noise Type/Level** | Rician Noise - Constant | Rician Noise - Constant | Rician Noise - Constant | **Rician Noise - Variable** |
| **Test PSNR (dB)** | 34.54 | 33.28 | 31.96 (Worst) | **37.62 (Highest)** |
| **Test SSIM** | 0.865 | 0.796 | 0.772 (Worst) | **0.9223 (Highest)** |
